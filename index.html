<h2>Migration flows</h2>
<p>This figure shows the 2018 internal migration flows for the regions of England.</p>
<p>IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.</p>

<div id="chart"></div>

<p>TODO: I still need to fix the tooltips to extract the numbers from the data matrix, I need to fix the axis positions, and the text wrapping as well as the direction and arrows of the flow. My goal is to produce the figure below.</p>
<p>Notice how there is a chord going from an area as well as a chord going into the area. I need to figure out how I am going to achieve this, as well as adding arrows.</p>
